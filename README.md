A multiple choice quiz designed to be used in Unity projects.  The original idea came from the Unity tutorial found here - https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/intro-and-setup?playlist=17117 but, as usually happens, it quickly grew from there.  

Goals are:

* ~Questions/answers from DB (using SQLLite)~ - commit 7/14/18 
* ~Varying number of answers are allowed.~  - commit 7/14/18
* ~Multiple correct answers are allowed.~  - commit 7/14/18
* Randomizing of questions for each test.  - changing the way we do this
* ~Answers to be selected together and then submitted~ - commit 7/15/18
* ~Question pools by category.~ - commit 7/18/18  
* ~Variable timing/difficulty.~ - commit 7/24/18
* ~At the end, review questions answered incorrectly.~ - commit 7/24/18 
* ~List question count during quiz. ~ - commit 7/25/18
* ~List number of questions at menu screen based on categories chosen. ~ - commit 7/25/18
* Whatever else occurs to me as we go along.  

As with my other projects, the code will be messy, painful to look at, and heavily commented.  I'm learning as I go here; so prepare yourself. :P
