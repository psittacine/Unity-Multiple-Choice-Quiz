A multiple choice quiz designed to be used in Unity projects.  The original idea came from the Unity tutorial found here - https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/intro-and-setup?playlist=17117 but, as usually happens, it quickly grew from there.  

Expansion goals are:

* ~Questions/answers from DB (using SQLLite)~ - commit 7/14/18 
* ~Varying number of answers are allowed.~  - commit 7/14/18
* ~Multiple correct answers are allowed.~  - commit 7/14/18
* ~Randomizing of questions for each test.~  - changed the way this happens 7/28/18
* ~Answers to be selected together and then submitted~ - commit 7/15/18
* ~Question pools by category.~ - commit 7/18/18  
* ~Variable timing/difficulty.~ - commit 7/24/18
*  At the end, review questions answered incorrectly. - Back on the menu, boys! Found a bug, hunting aggressively. 
* ~List question count during quiz.~ - commit 7/25/18
* ~List number of questions at menu screen based on categories chosen.~ - commit 7/25/18
* ~Settings menu at MenuScreen.~ - commit 7/28/18
* ~In-game menu to end round and exit game.~ -commit 7/28/18 
* Scoreboard integration with website.
* Whatever else occurs to me as we go along.  

As with my other projects, the code will be messy, painful to look at, and heavily commented.  I'm learning as I go here; so prepare yourself. :P
