A multiple choice quiz designed to be used in Unity projects.  The original idea came from the Unity tutorial found here - https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/intro-and-setup?playlist=17117, but as usually happens, it quickly grew from there.  

Goals are:

* Questions/answers from DB (using SQLLite) 
* Varying number of answers are allowed.  
* Multiple correct answers are allowed.  
* Randomizing of questions for each test.  
* Question pools by category.  
* Variable timing/difficulty.  
* At the end, review questions answered incorrectly.  
* Whatever else occurs to me as we go along.  

As with my other projects, the code will be messy, painful to look at, and heavily commented.  I'm learning as I go here; so you've been warned!
